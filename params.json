A script is run as a job and this job has various pieces of information stored with it such as the output of the script, whether it suceeded or failed, the name of the script, who ran the script etc.                                                                                                            \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\nThis plugin allows the user to view all the job details, and also allows a running script to be stopped.                                                                            \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\n**NOTE**: Any user can view the output of any job.\r\n\r\nSee [obdi-core-repository](https://github.com/mclarkson/obdi-core-repository)\r\nfor more information.\r\n",
